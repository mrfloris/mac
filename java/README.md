# Java (JDK / JVM)

A future page about the Java server.

- Java 22.0.2 via Oracle
- Download "ARM64 Compressed Archive" for M1->M4 `[https://download.oracle.com/java/23/latest/jdk-23_macos-aarch64_bin.tar.gz](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk23-mac)` or https://jdk.java.net/archive/
- Unpack .tar.gz and place `jdk-22.0.2.jdk` in the `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines` directory. (yes, it will prompt for pass)
- `java --version` should say 22.0.2
- Optionally, you can remove the older instances if you believe you no longer need those.
- used for "java -jar paper.jar" to launch a Minecraft (test) server locally.
