My Mac (dev) setup

Once in a while, I get questions about how I set up my (new) Apple Mac system. This repository will allow me to start collecting that information and keep it up to date, and to point those who have these questions to it. It also helps me learn through contributions/suggestions by others. Feel free to clone and use this for yourself, if you find it handy, or clone and PR and make some useful contributions to this little project.

## Current System

My current system is a 2020 Apple Mac Mini M1 with a 1TB Nvme SSD, 16GB RAM, and running macOS 13.5. It serves as my daily driver, allowing me to spread my workload between it and my older 2017 iMac, which mainly runs services.
