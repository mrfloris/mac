My Mac (dev) setup

Once in a while, I get questions about how I set up my (new) Apple Mac system. This repository will allow me to start collecting that information and keep it up to date, and to point those who have these questions to it. It also helps me learn through contributions/suggestions by others. Feel free to clone and use this for yourself, if you find it handy, or clone and PR and make some useful contributions to this little project.

## Current System

My current system is a 2020 Apple Mac Mini M1 with a 1TB Nvme SSD, 16GB RAM, and running macOS 13.5. It serves as my daily driver, allowing me to spread my workload between it and my older 2017 iMac, which mainly runs services.

## Latest Update

- This repository's latest update is a snapshot of August 1st, 2023. 
- Version 0.0.2 (concept), build 003.

## How does this work?

Before you go through my list, I want to clarify that this is not a step-by-step guide. Rather, it is a collection of my preferences based on my interests, which include Minecraft server management, HTML/CSS, markdown document writing, documentation creation, and participation in existing projects. I am not a professional in any of these areas, but I find that the programs and tools I install make my daily usage of the Mac system more enjoyable and efficient.

## Contributions / Credit

I want to give credit to those who have inspired me to create this list and to those who have contributed to it. Any clone or pull request contributions will be acknowledged and included here.

## Prerequisites 

Before I do almost anything with a new system. I go through the basics, which helps me then quickly set up the rest.

- I make sure the system has the correct Apple ID / iCloud setup, so I have access to my iCloud files, as well as my Apps
- Then I install 1Password, so I can quickly login to services for Apple, Google, Microsoft, etc. more conveniently.

- Chrome
- FireFox

I use Safari to check things without being logged in, I use Chrome as my main browser. And I have Firefox for all the exceptions or to double-check something.

- For my sanity I get Alfred, but I will list it below as a homebrew install. 

- HomeBrew ([brew.sh](https://brew.sh/)) You can manually install this, or open Terminal.app from macOS and run:
  `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`

Homebrew is the package manager that is just super handy to quickly get a bunch of stuff installed, and updated, it helps you make your mac feel a bit more linux-ey.. if that makes sense. 

Once Homebrew is installed, we have access to accounts through 1Password again, it's time to start tweaking the system.
